## Definition
A diagram to visualize a [[set]].
In general, a Venn diagram of two sets consists of four areas: three inside the ovals, and one outside. The latter is sometimes forgotten. For three sets there are eight, for four sets sixteen.

**Bad side of Venn diagrams**
After 4 sets they get big and unreadable
