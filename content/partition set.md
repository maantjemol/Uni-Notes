# partition set
**course:**
## Definition
### Rules:
1. A is an partition set and contains ${A_{1}, A_{2}... A_{n}}$
2. $A_i$ is part of $S$, and $A_1$ is not nothing.
3. The intersection of $A_{i}\text{ and }A_j$ is nothing zolang i niet j is 
4. De union van alle sets A zijn set S

### Example:
>[!abstract] Definition
>
>partition of S: **some disjoint nonempty subsets that together** **are S.** 
>{ {1,4}, {2}, {3,5,6} } is a partition of { 1,2,3,4,5,6 }
>*There is no overlap between them*
