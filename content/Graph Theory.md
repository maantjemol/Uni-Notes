Graphs consist of nodes and edges. Edges are the connections between nodes. Undirected graphs dont have a direction, directed graphs do. A graph is basically a special type of [[relation]]. 

Graphs in this course are always **finite**. Many results about graphs only apply to the finite case. We look at both **undirected** **graphs** and **directed graphs**. 

The definition directly implies that it is about undirected graphs: edges have no special direction (unordered pairs, sets). It also follows from the definition that a graph does not have multiple edges (E is a set) and also no loops (edges are sets).
