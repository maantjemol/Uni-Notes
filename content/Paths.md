**Trail:** a path where you only visit edges once.
**Simple path:** a path where you only visit distinct vertices.

## Types of paths:
*Closed path*: $V_{0}=V_{n}$ it's just a loop 
*Circuit*: Closed path where you only visit edges once(closed trail) 
*Cycle*: Closed path with distinct vertices

> Suppose u, v âˆˆ V(G) and there is a path from u to v in which vertex x occurs twice: xi = xj = x. Then we can omit the intermediate vertices (and corresponding edges).
