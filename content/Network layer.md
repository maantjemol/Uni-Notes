**Routing:**
You have a packet you want to send from one place to another. You bring it to your ISP and they decide how that is done.
First they have a whole networks of switches. The packet is dropped of by the closed switch. The switch inspects the header. The header indicates what the switch needs to do. The ISP will than look at it's network of switches and decide what route they want to use for this packet.  You have different algorithms that decide what route is the "best". This can be the fastest or cheapest 

**Forwarding:**
