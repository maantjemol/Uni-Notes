# deadlocking
**course:**
## Definition
When [[Multi-threading]] two [[process]]es asks for mutual access of 2 parts of [[memory]], because of [[Race conditions]] they get caught in a deadlock:
In concurrent computing, deadlock is any situation in which no member of some group of entities can proceed because each waits for another member, including itself, to take action, such as sending a message or, more commonly, releasing a lock.
