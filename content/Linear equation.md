title: Linear equation

## Definition:
$ax_{1} + ax_{2} + ax_{3} + ax_{4} + ax_{5} + ax_{6} = b$
Where $a$ is the **coefficient**
and $x$ the **variable**
and $b$ is the **constant**

$x^2$ is not linear because of the $^2$

## Systems
A system of linear equations is:
$x_{1}+ x_{2}=1$
$x_1-x_{2}= 0$
This is $\frac{1}{2}$ 

If there is no solution, a system is called **inconsistent**
If there are solutions, a system is called **consistent**
