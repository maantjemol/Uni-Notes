A CPU is build up of different parts:
- ALU | Arithmetic logic unit
	- You can send intructions to the ALU to let it carry out the instructions. 
	- It interacts with otner parts of the [[CPU]] 
- Instruction decoder:
	- Decodes the instructions in [[memory]] and sends it to the ALU for use.
- [[program counter]] is used to point to the part of the program in memory the instruction decoder needs to send to the ALU.
- The program in the memory is build by the [[assembler]].
