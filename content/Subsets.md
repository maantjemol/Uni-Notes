# Subsets
**course:**
## Definition
A is a [[Subsets]] of B if every element form A can also be found in B
**Theorem:**
Let A, B and C be any sets. Then: 
- (i) A ⊆ A *Reflexive*
- (ii) if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A, then A = B *anti-symmetric* 
- (iii) if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C, then A ⊆ C *transitive*

**Notation:**
- A ⊆ B means that every element of A can also be found in B: for all x, if x ∈ A, then x ∈ B
- A ⊆ B, subset: inclusion, A is contained/included in B, B contains/includes A 
- A ⊂ B, proper subset: B has at least one more element than A!

Analogy to inequality. If x ≤ y, then either:  
- x = y or 
- x < y
