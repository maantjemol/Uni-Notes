## Definition
*Interior point:*
We say that a [[functions]] f is CONTINUOS at an interior point c of its domain 
1. $\lim_{x\to c} f(x)=f(c)$
*Boundary points:*
We say that: 
2. $f()$ is right continuous at c if $\lim_{x\to c+} f(x)=f(c)$ 
3. $f()$ is left continuous at c if $\lim_{x\to c-} f(x)=f(c)$ 

We have a finite closed interval [a, b] 
we say that $f$ is continuous  on [a, b] if the previous rules 1, 2 & 3 apply

## Theorem 1:
$f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, finite closed interval:
Then there exist at least two points p,q in $[a, b]$
such that $f\left( p\right) \leq f\left( x\right) \leq f\left( q\right)$
For all x in $[a,b]$

## Theorem 2:
Suppose $f$ is continuous on [a,b] finite closed interval 
Suppose $s$ is in between $f(a), f(b)$
then there *exitsts* point c in [a, b]
such that $f(c)=s$
**Intermediate value theorem**
Line always crosses red line:
suppose $f(a)<0 \& f(b) > 0$  then there exists [a,b] $f(c)=0$

This theorem guarentees that there are no roots between the points:
