## Reflexive:
All elements must relate to themselves.

## Irreflexive:
**provided that no element is related to itself** so no ( 1 , 1 )

## Symmetric & Antisymmetric 
A symmetric relation is a type of binary relation. An example is the relation "is equal to", because if a = b is true then b = a is also true.

In mathematics, a binary relation R on a set X is antisymmetric if there is no pair of distinct elements of X each of which is related by R to the other.

## Transitive

## P-closure:
Add as little as possible to a [[relation]] so it becomes transitive or any other type of relation.
