# Race conditions
**course:**
## Definition
Race conditions happen when 2 [[Threads]] want to write to the same part of [[memory]]. They race each other. This is solved by [[Threads]] requesting access to part of [[memory]] before writing. When they have requested access the thread has exclusive access. Other threads cannot write to that part of [[memory]]. When a thread gives up access it can be used by other [[Threads]].
