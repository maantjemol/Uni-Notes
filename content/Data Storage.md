# Data Storage
**course:**
## Definition
Data is stored on a hard disk or flash drive or other storage medium. These devices also need [[driver]]s. To interact with the data on a usb stick you need a file system. A file system does a few things:
- folders 
- files 
- Corrections: if something goes wrong(power outage) it can stop the write and cancel it
- access rights
The file system is a bridge between the data and the [[operating system]]. With the file system you can read the data.
