## **Sets:** [[set]]
>[!abstract] Definition
>
>Set is a collection of things. A set is a concept intended to turn serveral seperate objects into one whole, new object. They are the basis of modern mathematics. A aset consists of elements.  

### Notation:
$A = \{ 2, 3, 4, 5 \}$
$2 ∈ A$
2 is in A

$A = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4\}$
$B = \{ 2, 3\}$
$A \subseteq B$

$\{X | X \text{ is even and } X \geq 0\}$
Means^: $\{0, 2, 4, ...\}$

### Operations: [[set operations]]
#### Union: ∪ 
Combine sets:

#### Intersection: ∩
Intersect sets

#### Compliment:
Everything outside A

#### Difference:
A / B

### Powersets: [[powerset set]]

>powerset of S: **it contains all subsets of a set S.** P ({a,b}) = { 0/, {a}, {b}, {a,b} }

### Partition set: [[partition set]] 
>[!abstract] Definition
>
>partition of S: **some disjoint nonempty subsets that together** **are S.** 
{ {1,4}, {2}, {3,5,6} } is a partition of { 1,2,3,4,5,6 }
*There is no overlap between them*


## **Pairs:** [[pairs]]
2 pairs are equal:
- $(a,b) = (c,d)$ if $a = c$ and $b = d$
- (A, B) is not equal to (B, A)  $\to$  *ELEMENTS*
- {A, B} is equal to {B, A}  $\to$  *SETS*
