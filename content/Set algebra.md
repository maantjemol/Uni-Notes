# Set algebra
**course:**
## Definition
A [[Calculus]] for sets.

**Principle of Duality**
When we perform duality, then the union will be replaced by intersection, or intersection will be replaced by the union. The universal will also be replaced by null, or null will be replaced by universal.

**Operations:**
commutativity x+y = y+x  
associativity x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z

∆ is a operations
commutativity x ∆ y = y ∆ x 
associativity x ∆ (y ∆ z) = (x ∆ y) ∆ z

commutativity A∩B = B∩A,  A∪B = B∪A 
associativity A∩(B∩C) = (A∩B)∩C,  A∪(B∪C) = (A∪B)∪C

This also works for symetric difference, but it does not for difference

**Unit and Zero elements:**
- 1 ⋅ x = x unit element 
- 0 ⋅ x = 0 zero element
