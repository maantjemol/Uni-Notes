# Transport layer
**course:**
## Definition
The [[Transport layer]] makes sure you can connect from 1 [[computer]] to another. There are 2 different [[protocols]]:
- UDP:
	- Connectionless transport. Doesn's care if the message arives or not. It just sends them. The order of arival is not important 
- TCP:
	- Creates a communication tunnel and makes sure the messages get received in the right order and are received at all.

*Multiplexing:*
- The sharing of a TCP connection between different processes. There are several things coming in and serveral things coming out.
