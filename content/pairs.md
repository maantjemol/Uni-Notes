A set of all ordered pairs [0, 1], [2,5],[1,3] with x is part of A and y is part of B

2 pairs are equal:
- $(a,b) = (c,d)$ if $a = c$ and $b = d$
- (A, B) is not equal to (B, A)  ->  *ELEMENTS*
- {A, B} is equal to {B, A}  ->  *SETS*

## Example 1: (finite)
```javascript
for (element_A in A){
	for (element_B in B){
		return (element_A, element_B)
	}
}
```
