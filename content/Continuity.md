# Continuity
**course:**
## Definition:
In mathematics, a continuous function is a function such that a continuous variation of the argument induces a continuous variation of the value of the function. This means that there are no abrupt changes in value, known as discontinuities
**Continuous or not:**
- Polynomials: Yes 
- Rational functions: Yes 
- Rational Powers: Yes, on it's domain
- $\cos, \sin, \tan$: Yes, on their respective domains 
- $|x|$: Yes 
- $sign(x)$: Yes

### Theorem:
Suppose $f, g$ are continuous at c. then $f\pm g, f\cdot g, \frac{f}{g} \text{ if } g\ne0$ are also continuous at c. $f(x)^{1/n}$ if $n$ is even

Suppose $f,g$ such that $f(g(x))$ is definded on an interval containing c. if $\lim_{x\to c} g(x) = L$ and if f is continuous at $L$, then $f(g(x))$ is continuous at c

## Examples:
A set of all input (values) accepted by the [[functions]].
$$f(x)=\sqrt{x}, \text{  } x\ge0 \text{ <-- this is the domain}$$
$$g(x)=\sqrt{4-x^2}$$
Domain is [-2, 2] want anders negatieve wortel

Empty dot means the point is not there.

## Types of intervals:
**Definition:**
*Continuous:*
We say that $f$ is continuous on $I$ if it is continuous at each point of $I$.

*Interior point:*
We say that a [[functions]] f is CONTINUOS at an interior point c of its domain 
$$\lim_{x\to c} f(x)=f(c)$$
The limit must exists & $=f(c)$

*Boundary points:*
We say that: 
- $f()$ is right continuous at c if $\lim_{x\to c+} f(x)=f(c)$ 
- $f()$ is left continuous at c if $\lim_{x\to c-} f(x)=f(c)$

boundary point = point on one of the edges of the interval.
