## Basics:
sum rule:
|A∪B| = |A|+|B|-|A∩B|
number of ways to choose an object from A or B

product rule:
|A x B| = |A|⋅|B|
number of ways to choose an object from A and an object from B

power rule:
|P(A)| = $2^{|A|}$
number of ways to choose some different objects from A (including no object)

## Choices 
n objects, choice of k(\*)
- with/without repetition
objects different or not
- (un)ordered
order significant; that is sequence versus set
