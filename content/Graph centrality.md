In “social network analysis” one tries to define values that indicate how central nodes are in a graph, a measure of importance. 

This can be, for example, a measure that indicates 
(a) how many paths run through that node, 
(b) what is the total/average distance to the other nodes, 
(c) the degree of the node 
The warm colours in the pictures are more central than the cold according to the concerning measure.
