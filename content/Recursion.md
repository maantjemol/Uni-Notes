## Well-defined:
To really be able to calculate something with it the function must be **well-defined**. Inductive definitions are well-defined as they obeys the following two requirements: 
1. One or more **base values** of the function are **directly given** 
2. The function always refers to itself in a “smaller “cases, that is, closer to a base value.
