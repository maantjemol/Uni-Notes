# segmentation
**course:**
## Definition
when there is not enough space to put 2 blocks of memory after each other the [[operating system]] will use segmentation to use 2 different blocks. localy these blocks will be consecutive but for the [[operating system]] these blocks are not after each other and they need to get mapped to diffrent parts. Segmentation is slow so it's best to use it as little as possible.
