# memory
**course:**
## Definition
A place for the computer to store 0s and 1s. 
Types of memory(from slow to fast) are:
- [[registers]] 
- [[cache]] 
- [[RAM]] 
- Harddrive
- Cache and memory are often swapped when a process needs them. When A needs to access [[RAM]] the [[operating system]] swaps it to [[cache]] for the proces to use. 
The faster the memory, the more expensive it is.

Uses [[Combinational logic#^b656ea]](a lot of flipflops) to make memory

**What to do when memory is full?** 
- The part of memory that is not used gets saved to the harddrive. This is saved in pages([[paging]]).
