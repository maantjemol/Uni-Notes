Walking along a path in a graph. The length of the path is the number of vertices visited.

**Trail:** a path where you only visit edges once.
**Simple path:** a path where you only visit distinct vertices.

## Types of paths:
*Closed path*: $V_{0}=V_{n}$ it's just a loop 
*Circuit*: Closed path where you only visit edges once(closed trail) 
*Cycle*: Closed path with distinct vertices

> [!INFO] Definition 
> Suppose u, v âˆˆ V(G) and there is a path from u to v in which vertex x occurs twice: xi = xj = x. Then we can omit the intermediate vertices (and corresponding edges).

## Distance:
> [!INFO] Definition 
> The **distance** between two nodes **u** and **v** is the length (nr. of edges) of a shortest path between **u** and **v**.

Notation: *d(u,v)*
d(u,v) = 0 iff u = v
d(u,v) = d(v,u)
