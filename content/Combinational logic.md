**course:**
## Definition
**Boolean logic:**

**Logic gates:**
You can use logic gates to implement alot of things. They are build from [[transistor]]s 

**Clock:**
The clock is used to time computations.

**Sequential logic:**
- Latches/flip-flops: ^b656ea
	- a flipflop stores a single binary number.

- State machine:

The state machine is used to loop over the state [[memory]] 

- Parallelism:
	- There are happening a lot of things in paralell, otherwise it would be really slow 

**Hardware description language:**
A programming language to describe you hardware. There are a few different ones like Verilog of VHDL.

**Digital building blocks:**
combinatorial blocks:
- 1-bit full adder: 
	- Adds 2 bits with a carrier:

	- [[memory]]

**Logic arrays:**
- array of logic gates, You can not change the hardware after you build it.

**FPGA:**
Field programmable gate array. You can change the logic arrays to build your own chips. It is reversable
