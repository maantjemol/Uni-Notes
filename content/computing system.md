# computing system
**course:**
## Definition
A [[computing system]] consists of computing devices: electronic, quantum, biological. Electronic computers run programs that may share computing resources. Larger systems typically consist of many interconnected computers.
You can think of computer systems:
- operating systems 
- computer networks 
- computer architecture 

**Digital:**
A digital computing system has discrete time. That means that there is a set time between instructions. There is also a discrete representation of information as bits. This allows for simple handeling of errors and imperfactions. Even though limited, this use of bits is very succesful.
