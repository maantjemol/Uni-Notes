# Context switching
**course:**
## Definition
Procedure that a computer's CPU follows to change from one task (or [[process]]) to another while ensuring that the tasks do not conflict. It does this by saving diffrent processes to [[memory]]. When we switch to a new [[process]] we use the information stored in [[RAM]] about that process to switch to the other [[process]].
