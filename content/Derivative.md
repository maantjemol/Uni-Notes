# Derivative
**course:**
## Definition
$$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}=f'(x)$$
We will focus on $C^{1}=[a,b]$  [[functions]], that means the function is [[derivative]] ones and it is continuous.

**Common rules:**

## Theorem 1:
if $f(x)$ is differentiable at $x$, then $f$ is continuous at x
**Proof:**

## Theorem 3. Product Rule:
$$(f(x)\cdot g(x))',\text{ } f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)$$

## Theorem 5. Quotient rule:
$$(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)})'=\frac{nat-tan}{n^2}$$
## Theorem 6. Chain Rule
