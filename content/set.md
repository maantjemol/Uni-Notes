# Set theory
**course:**
## Definition
Set is a collection of things. A set is a concept intended to turn serveral seperate objects into one whole, new object. They are the basis of modern mathematics. A aset consists of elements.  
- [[powerset set]] 
- [[partition set]] 

**Notation:**
A = { 2, 3, 4, 5 }
1 ∈ A 
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
1 belongs to set A

**Extensional**: explicity listing the elements using dots is necessary
A = {1, 2, 3, 4} set with a set amount of elements 
B = {1, 2 ...}
C = {1, 2, ..., 81, 82}

**Intensional**
{X | X is even and X >= 0}  means:
{0, 2, 4, ...}

**Universal set**
A = {0, 2, 4, 6, . . . } = {x|x is an integer ≥ 0 and x is even} 
                                          ⇓ 
                                U universal set

**Subsets:**
- [[Subsets]]

**Set operations**
- [[set operations]]

**Other rules:**
1. Order in a set does not matter, duplicates are irrelevant.
	{1, 2} = {2, 1} = {1, 2, 1}
	If using a [[mulitset]], duplicates do matter
2. Two sets are equal if they contain the same elements:
	A = B is defined as x ∈ A if and only if x ∈ B.
	x ∈ A <=> x ∈ B
1 ∈ A 
1 belongs to set A
