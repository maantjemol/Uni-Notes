An inductive proof is a method to prove a property of objects that are inductively defined. Also called mathematical induction when it comes to ℕ.

Coinductive definition = recursively defined objects in which larger objects are decomposed into smaller one.

A coinductive proof is a method to prove a property of objects that are coinductively defined.
